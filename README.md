# Cooking Ingredient Object Detection

## Introduction
Our Cooking Ingredient Object Detection project seamlessly merges YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection technology and AI analytics, redefining how we engage with food. Leveraging the power of Python, the backend of our system efficiently processes and analyzes images or videos with YOLO, providing instant and accurate ingredient identification.

The intuitive interface, built using the Streamlit framework, allows users to effortlessly capture moments in the kitchen. Whether you snap a photo, record a video, or open your camera, the system automatically identifies ingredients and recommends personalized recipes. Streamlit enhances the overall user experience, making it easy for users to decide what's on the menu for dinner.
